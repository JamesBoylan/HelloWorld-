      As I started to say in the About me page, I enjoy playing video games. I enjoy playing with the bois. Games like Destiny 2, Overwatch, garry's mod, and the JackBox series are very fun to play with the bois. I also enjoy to hang out with the bois on weekends anda such. Watching youtube is also a like of mine. I enjoy watching my favorite gamers gaming. I also enjoy school to a certain extent. I enjoy coming to school and learning about things that interest me, but sometimes I don't wanna go  to school because not everything at design tech is something I want to do everyday.
