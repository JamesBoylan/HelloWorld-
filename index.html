        The game Dead By Daylight is not a game which should be praised by JC at the level he is doing so. The game is repetitive and doesn't have a long lifespan. The game should be played with friends for maybe 5 hours, max. The fact that JC finds this game to be as fun as he does is completelt obsurd. He should think over the facts that have been brought up to him in past discussions.
            <br>
            It is a fine game but not to the same level others are
